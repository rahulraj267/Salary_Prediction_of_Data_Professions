# Project Name: Salary Predictions of Data Professions

Welcome to the Machine Learning Internship, focused on predicting the salaries of data professionals. In 
this project, you will dive into the world of regression tasks and gain hands-on experience in data 
analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development. The goal is to predict the 
salaries of data professionals based on a rich dataset.

# Problem Statement:

Salaries in the field of data professions vary widely based on factors such as experience, job role, and 
performance. Accurately predicting salaries for data professionals is essential for both job seekers and 
employers. 

# Your Mission:

Your mission in this internship is to build a predictive model for salaries of data professionals. You will 
follow these key steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive into the dataset, conduct comprehensive EDA, and unveil 
valuable insights about data professionals' salaries. EDA will involve data visualization, summary 
statistics, and identifying patterns in the data.
2. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones that can provide additional 
insights or improve model performance. Feature engineering might involve deriving features related to 
experience, job role, and performance.
3. Data Preprocessing: Prepare the data for model training. This includes handling missing values, 
encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features as needed.
4. Machine Learning Model Development: Train various machine learning regression models to predict 
salaries. Experiment with different algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, 
and gradient boosting to find the best-performing model.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of your models using appropriate evaluation metrics like 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Rsquared (R2) score. Identify the model that provides the most accurate salary predictions.
6. ML Pipelines and Model Deployment: Create ML Pipelines to streamline the end-to-end machine 
learning process, from data preprocessing to model training. Additionally, deploy a model that can 
generate predictions for unseen data. Consider using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for deployment.
7. Recommendations: Based on your findings and insights from the model, provide actionable 
recommendations. These recommendations can be related to factors influencing salaries and potential 
strategies for improving earnings in data professions.
